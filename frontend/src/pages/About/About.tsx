                Hello, I am a graduate student at Youngstown State University,
                holding a B.Sc. in Information Technology with a specialization
                in Application Development.
              </p>
              <p>
                A bit about my background: during the early years of my college
                education, I was drawn to the medical profession due to my
                interest in promoting human health and longevity. However, as I
                gained knowledge, I came to the realization that my passion for
                health fell short. Throughout those four years, I felt something
                was missing—a path that truly resonated with who I wanted to
                become.
              </p>
              <p>
                After much contemplation, I decided to pursue involvement in
                humanity's technological advancement—a realm of creativity,
                problem-solving, and exploration. This change of heart aligned
                with my daily activities and sparked my interest. My goal in
                this field is to seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and
                contribute meaningfully to its development. I am a firm believer
                in the value of continuous learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Drawing from my academic background and professional experience,
                I am proficient in a wide range of programming languages,
                frameworks, and methodologies. This specific information can be
                found under the “Download CV” or “Experience” section. Committed
                to staying at the forefront of technological advancements, I
                actively pursue continuous knowledge to expand my horizon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond coding, I find joy in taking walks in the park,
                appreciating the wonders of nature, exploring different
                cuisines, and playing video games whenever I have free time.
